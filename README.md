# Neofetch-SlimeAscii
A slime Ascii art I made 


this is  simply a modified neofetch file. I just added one of  my pixel art to be in ascii.
the ascii art start at line 11152.






# Installation 
`git clone`
`mv /~the-neofetch-file /bin`

then in `/.config/neofetch/config.conf`
to use it add `ascii_distro="slime"`.
